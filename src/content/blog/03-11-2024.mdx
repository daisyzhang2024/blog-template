## Motivational Monday

"If you can remove the idea that dieting is something you have to endure and think of it as something that makes you feel better about your body and mind, you will lose weight without stress!"

## Goals

- Make a healthy breakfast (overnight oats) ✅
- Make a healthy dinner (salad w/ salmon) ✅
- Do Chloe Ting Workout ✅
- Drink a full HRT thing of water (meh pretty much) ✅
- Learn to reward myself not by eating, but through healthier avenues (shopping, reading, socializing)
- Eat healthy all the time without snacking. Exceptions are when I'm eating out with friends or family (forced to not eat healthy).
- 60 minutes of exercise per day ✅
