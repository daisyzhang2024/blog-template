## Tips & Notes

- Add your other favorite veggies such as baby corn, sliced carrots, red bell pepper, or mushrooms, keeping in mind that different vegetables cook at different times
- For a lower sodium option, choose low sodium tamari or soy sauce, or coconut aminos
- Swap the tempeh for the best crispy tofu, skipping the tamari in this recipe
- Serve over your favorite grain such as brown rice, quinoa, or bulgur or try cauliflower rice
