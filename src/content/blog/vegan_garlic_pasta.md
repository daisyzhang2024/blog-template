## Ingredients

- 1 cup grape tomatoes (halved)
- 3 ounces whole wheat pasta
- Olive oil
- 1 medium shallots (diced)
- 2 large cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 pinch each sea salt and black pepper
- 1 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened plain Almond Breeze
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
- Some veggies

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and toss tomatoes in a bit of olive oil and sea salt. Place cut side up on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes while you prepare the rest of the dish. Then set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta.
3. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and the garlic and shallot. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper and stir frequently, cooking for 3-4 minutes until softened and fragrant.
   Stir in flour. Once combined, slowly whisk in the almond milk a little at a time so clumps donâ€™t form. Then add nutritional yeast, another healthy pinch of salt and black pepper, and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes to thicken.
4. Once the sauce is to your desired thickness, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Then add pasta and roasted tomatoes and stir. Serve with veggies!

## Tips & Notes

- Can add a splash of lemon juice or vegan parmesean cheese for extra flavor!
