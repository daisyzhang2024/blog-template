## Ingredients

- Oats (1/2 cup, 45 g)
- Unsweetened almond milk (1/4 cup, 60 ml)
- Baking powder (1/2 tsp, 2.5 g)
- 1 large egg (or omit if prefer vegan)
- 1/2 ripened banana

## Instructions

1. Prepare the batter by blending the batter ingredients together.
2. Add in any mix-in ingredients & stir them into the batter mixture.
3. Bake in air fryer at 300 F/149 C for 12-15 minutes, OR bake in oven at 350 F / 177 C for 25-30 minutes. All air fryers & ovens are different, so cooking times may vary.

## Tips & Notes

- For all recipes, use rolled or quick oats, do not use steel cut oats. Instead of 1/2 of oats, feel free to substitute with 1/3 cup of oat flour.
- For STORAGE: Store in air-tight container in refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in air fryer or oven before eating for best results.
