## Ingredients

- 72 g pasta
- 200g pumpkin
- 5-6 cloves of garlic
- 1/4 tablespoon olive oil
- Handful sage leaves
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (more or less depending how spicy you like it)
- 16 g nutritional yeast flakes
- Salt and cracked black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F
2. Chop pumpkin into pieces, cut the skin off and place in a baking dish. Chop the top off the garlic heads and place into the same dish.
3. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the pumpkin and garlic and season with salt. Massage the oil into the vegetables so they are all nicely coated and bake in the oven for about 45 minutes.
4. Allow to cool slightly then squeeze the garlic bulbs so that the flesh pops out and into the pumpkin dish. Using an immersion blender or blender, blend the pumpkin and garlic until smooth and there are no chunks
5. Boil pasta in heavily salted water. At the same time, saute the sage leaves in a skillet over medium heat with a spoon of olive oil for a few minutes.
6. Remove the sage leaves once crisp and add the red pepper flakes. After a minute add the pumpkin puree with a ladle of pasta water
7. When the pasta is almost cooked and al dente, add pasta straight to the pan. Add grated parmesan cheese along with a ladle of reserved pasta water. Gently mix until well combined, adding more pasta water if needed or if too thick
8. Top with the crispy sage leaves, freshly grated parmesan cheese and ground black pepper and enjoy your delicious pumpkin pasta !

## Tips & Notes

- Don't cut the pumpkin pieces into very small pieces as they can dry out in the oven. You'll want them to be in cubes or chunks
- Ensure to rub olive oil on the top of the garlic heads to make sure they don't burn
- Keep an eye on the sage leaves so they don't burn when fried
- Make sure to reserve some pasta water. This helps the sauce become nice and silky rather than too thick
  Grate Parmigiano Reggiano cheese finely so it melts in the pan easily. If it's grated too thick, it can clump up when it melts in the pasta
- Herbal Infusion. You can substitute the sage for either thyme or rosemary or for some extra depth use a mixture of these
