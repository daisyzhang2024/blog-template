## Motivational Monday

"Losing weight is 70% diet, 30% exercise."
"It’s okay to struggle, but it’s not okay to give up on yourself."
“Remember that weight loss takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and stay committed to your goals, even when progress feels slow.”
"Portion control is still important. Pay attention to serving sizes and avoid mindless eating."
