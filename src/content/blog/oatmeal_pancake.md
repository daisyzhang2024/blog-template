## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsweetened almond milk
- ½ cup whole milk Greek yogurt
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups whole rolled oats
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- Fresh fruit, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a blender, place the almond milk, yogurt, egg, maple syrup, avocado oil, vanilla, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and stir to ensure that the batter is evenly combined.
2. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and brush lightly with oil. Use a ⅓-cup measuring cup to pour the batter into the pan. Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until puffed and golden brown, reducing the heat as needed and working in batches as necessary. The remaining batter will thicken between batches. If it becomes too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 more tablespoons almond milk as needed.
3. Serve fresh fruit and enjoy!

## Tips & Notes

- Makes about 6 pancakes.
